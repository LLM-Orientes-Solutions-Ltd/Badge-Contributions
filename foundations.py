# FOr the basics in the contributions system you should know a basic system of the foundation models over the data system and LLM technologies
print("weâ€™ve managed to build AI systems that can learn from thousands, or millions, of examples to help us better understand our world, or find new solutions to difficult problems. These large-scale models have led to systems that can understand when we talk or write, such as the natural-language processing and understanding programs we use every day, from digital assistants to speech-to-text programs. Other systems, trained on things like the entire work of famous artists, or every chemistry textbook in existence, have allowed us to build generative models that can create new works of art based on those styles, or new compound ideas based on the history of chemical research.")
